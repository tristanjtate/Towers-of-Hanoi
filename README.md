## Overview

The Towers of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle consisting of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes. The goal of the puzzle is to move all the disks from the source rod to the destination rod, following these rules:

1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. Each move consists of taking the top disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
3. No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

## How to Play

The game begins with all disks stacked in ascending order of size on the source rod, with the smallest disk at the top. The objective is to move the entire stack to the destination rod, obeying the rules mentioned above.
